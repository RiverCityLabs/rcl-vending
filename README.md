rcl-vending
===========

Code and documentation for the RCL network-enabled vending machine.

Will probably eventually consist of three sections.

1) Raspberry Pi/Flask/Whatever web server to provide a web interface.
2) Arduino sketch to link the web server (via serial) to digital I/O controlling the machine.
3) Diagrams and parts lists regarding how everything is put together.
