This directory (/vendingmachine/arduino) contains code/notes for the 
Arduino portion of the River City Labs Makerspace network-enabled
vending machine.

The Arduino is used to bridge from the web server (which will probably
be running on a RasPi), to all of the digital I/O that the machine will
require.
